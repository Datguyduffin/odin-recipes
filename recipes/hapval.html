    <h1>Happy Valentines Day!</h1>
    <h3>Trust me</h3>
    <p>So, I wanted to do just a card for Valentines Day<br> But I thought this could be better and more fun to do <br> it didn't help with all that happened with work and this virtual machine not working.<br> Almost gave up on it all but you know what I'm
        doing it now and it'll be worth it to me.<br> I will be honest, I hope this doesn't make you feel uncomfortable and know this comes from a good place<br> I will be deleting this probably after monday.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Now I am enjoying this, learning to code and work with this stuff again. Glad to have you along side,<br> more like ahead of me, to keep me motivated in this and focused on it.<br> Now I know we talked about you having someone to go through this with
        you so you could have someone to be your workout partner.<br> I do apologize for carrying as much weight but I hope I help keep you going with the projects. So just know that I haven't and won't give up on learning this,<br> and I do enjoy doing
        this, its just better having you to talk about it.</p>
    <p>I am a lucky person to have you still with me over all these years.<br> We always keep good contact and check in with one another.<br> and like I have said in the past, you have kept me inspired to do better and take better care of myself.<br> I want
        you to know I really appreciate it all. You are a great fucking friend!<br> I was going to try and figure out how to jazz this all up with CSS but, <br> it has been a difficult go getting my virtual machine to run the shit. But that's beside the
        point I am trying to make,<br>just me being a dork right now and wanting to wish you, <br>
        <br> <strong>Happy Valentines Day Sarah!</strong> Hope you have a great great day!<br>

    </p>
