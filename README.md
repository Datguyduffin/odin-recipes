# odin-recipes
So this is my first project of Odin Project,
I am making a small web design for Recipes.
Using HTML knowledge I have just learned and putting it to use.
I will be making a total of four web pages, 
	an index
	first recipe
	second recipe
	third recipe
Using the code I have learned to make links on the index
to each recipe with images for each one.
This will help me work on file structure when building websites.
As well help with creating links and images on to the pages.
